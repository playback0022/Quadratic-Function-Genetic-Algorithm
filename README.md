## General Description
Script computing the maximum value of a quadratic function on a given interval,
on which the provided function only takes positive values, using a genetic algorithm. 
Selection, crossover and mutation phases are emulated for each generation.
A lengthy and detailed report of the operations which take place is printed to the 
standard output and a graph of the maximum and mean fitness is generated after execution.
More information can be found in the attached PDF, which is written in romanian.

## Dependencies
Both numpy, matplotlib and an adequate backend for matplotlib should be installed locally.
